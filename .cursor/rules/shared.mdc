Using artificial intelligence, the app allows users to quickly generate high-quality cards from any text, eliminating the time-consuming task of manual preparation. The application is targeted at a wide range of users, from students to professionals, who want to effectively use the spaced repetition technique to reinforce their knowledge. The MVP version focuses on key functionalities: AI-powered flashcard generation, flashcard management, and a simple learning system based on the SM-2 algorithm.

## Coding practices

### Guidelines for clean code

- Use feedback from linters to improve the code when making changes.
- Prioritize error handling and edge cases.
- Handle errors and edge cases at the beginning of functions.
- Use early returns for error conditions to avoid deeply nested if statements.
- Place the happy path last in the function for improved readability.
- Avoid unnecessary else statements; use if-return pattern instead.
- Use guard clauses to handle preconditions and invalid states early.
- Implement proper error logging and user-friendly error messages.
- Consider using custom error types or error factories for consistent error handling.
